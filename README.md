## Introduction
This project is a Power BI challenge that analyses Adidas' sales performance from 2020 to 2021. The objective is to gain comprehensive insights into Adidas' sales trends across various product categories, sales channels, geographic regions, and other significant aspects of the data. The analysis leverages key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, total units sold, average operating margin, total transactions, average price per unit, and month-over-month (MoM) trends. The goal is to identify patterns, provide data-driven insights for better inventory management, develop strategies to boost sales and make informed recommendations to enhance Adidas' overall business performance.
